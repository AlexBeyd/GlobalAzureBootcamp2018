All around the world user groups and communities want to learn about Azure and Cloud Computing!

On **April 21, 2018**, all communities will come together once again in the fifth great [Global Azure Bootcamp](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/) event!

You will find included in this repository all materials use during the demos so you can try them at home.

## Life after initial deployment
Life has been going very well at *Contoso* as they just released the first version of their latest product in production.

Yesterday, *Contoso* lack of visibility in production bite them back as issues started to appear, the support & development teams didn't have much information to help troubleshoot the errors. After a long retrospective meeting, they decided to improve their maturity in troubleshooting and management of their cloud infrastructure.

At the end of their meeting they agreed on the following:

* Use an Application Performance Management (APM) tool to improve the visibility of their application
* Centralize the logs of their application and activities in Azure
* Have an audit logs of VMs remote access in production
* Better control the network traffic reaching virtual machines
* Be better at troubleshooting hard to diagnose problems like high CPU or memory leaks
* Reduce the noise to ensure people are not flooded by emails when a problem occurs
* Ensure only the right people have access to the cloud infrastructure
* Allow people to create/maintain cloud resources which are aligned with the company new governance.

The team has been assigned a couple of days to find tools & put new processes in place to check all the action items of the list above. Excited, the team will actively start documenting themselves and working on this tomorrow.
